# 🤖 Task Tracker CLI – Because Why Click When You Can Type Furiously?

Welcome to the **Task Tracker CLI** — the command-line buddy that listens to your to-do list, silently judges it, and still doesn't question your life choices. 🫠

## 🧠 What Even Is This?

It's a to-do list.  
But in the terminal.  
Because you’re a *real* developer now and GUIs are for quitters. 💻🔥

You can:

- **add** tasks like a boss 💼  
- **delete** tasks like you delete your responsibilities 💨  
- **list** tasks like you're about to do them (but won't) 📝  
- **update** tasks because priorities change... or were never real 💁‍♂️

## 🚀 How to Use This Productivity Monster

Run these **sacred incantations** in your terminal:

```bash
node task-tracker add "Go to gym (lol)"
node task-tracker delete "Go to gym (lol)"
node task-tracker list
node task-tracker update "Go to gym (lol)" "Go to gym (for real this time)"
